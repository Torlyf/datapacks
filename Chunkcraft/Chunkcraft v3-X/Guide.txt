    run /function chunkcraft:spawn

To Send a Life to someone (Only sends One, Repeat if you want to do more.)
    /trigger GiftLife set 1

To Revive (or reset) Someone:
    run /execute as [Username] run function chunkcraft:revive

To Grant a new Life:

    and then
        /execute as Username run function chunkcraft:revive
