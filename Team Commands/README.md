Enough about me, Let's talk about this datapack.



 **What This Does:**
	This datapack aims to Create Easy functionallity for the /team command in minecraft.
	It makes 10 teams, simmilar to MCCI / MCC. (if you don't know what those are, it's ok :)
	It then allows you to sort randomly or pre-determined teams.
	Without editing, this pack supports up to 50 players into those teams, but can easily support more. (see below)
 
 **How To Use:**
	This datapack has 6 diffrent functions, which you can use by typing:"/function cteam:[Command]"
	Minecraft will help you out with this once you type the first part in, and it doesn't need the brakets.
	Just copy the below commands or remember "/function cteam"
	So what are these functions?

 **Commands:**

	/function cteam:create
	  This one will make 10 teams of diffrent colors, but also a "Spectator," "Host," and "CoHost" team.
	  If you want to rename or recolor any of the teams, edit that file.

	/function cteam:sort
	  This one sorts into pre-determined teams. You have to assign the players to their teams here, 
	  by typing in the Username of a player after the color of team they join.
	  If you have more players you will need to copy and paste some in this file!
	  Also make sure to add the Host and CoHost roles (if any) here.

	/function cteam:random
	  This sort 50 players into random teams evenly. 
	  You can easily increase this number by copy & pasting some code in this file! 
	  This is pretty well outlined in the code.
	  Also make sure to add the Host and CoHost roles (if any) here.

	/function cteam:reset
	  If someone new joins late, or something goes wrong you can reset the datapack by running this.
	  All it does is deletes the teams. Use cautiosly.

	/function cteam:glow
	  This applies the glowing effect indefinetly to all players (except players who are Spectators), but also makes the chat look a little uglier.
	  You can reset this by doing the next function.

	/function cteam:no_glow
	  This removes the all effects from all players, and fixes the chat colors. 
	  If you want the other chat, you can alternitivly run this next command:
	  /effect clear @a
